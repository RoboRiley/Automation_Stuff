// Note the {{element}} and {{apiresponse}} variables in the task. Element is in the task twice -- that is the part of the API response that you want to capture.  APIResponse is a copy and paste of an api response for whatever GET you are using. //

## Context
I need help finding the right way to reference nested responses from an API call using ZeroWork.  I will give you an example of how they do it and then give you the one I need help with.  

##This is ZeroWork's example from their documentation.

The API responds with:
{
    "id": "cmpl-GERzeJQ4lvqPk8SkZu4XMIuR",
    "object": "text_completion",
    "created": 1586839808,
    "model": "text-davinci:003",
    "choices": [
        {
            "text": â€œTHIS IS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT WE WANT TO SAVE"
            "index": 0,
            "logprobs": null,
            "finish_reason": "length"
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 5,
        "completion_tokens": 7,
        "total_tokens": 12
    }
}

Their documentation says: "Any value inside a list marked by square brackets needs to be accessed with numbers where 0 corresponds to the first item, 1 to the second, etc. placed into square brackets. Any value inside a nested object marked by braces needs to be accessed with its key placed into square brackets.

So, the record path to the 'text' element would be: choices[0]['text']"

## TASK 
I need the record path to the element {{element}}.  This is the API response that I need help with:

{{apiresponse}}

Please provide the record path I would use in ZeroWorks for the {{element}} element of that API response.
